# ODPS Template Family Plan

## Purpose

ODPS v4.2 is broad enough to describe many kinds of data products. A single full-schema example is too large for adoption. A small set of applied templates helps users start from the right pattern without learning the full schema first.

This plan defines an ODPS template family that can be added to the ODPS specification, documentation, examples, and SDK tooling.

The templates should be treated as application skeletons. They do not require new schema fields. They reuse the existing ODPS v4.2 schema areas.

## Design principles

1. Avoid maturity labels such as Bronze, Silver, Gold.
   These names imply quality tiers but do not explain the purpose of the template.

2. Avoid the word Dataset in template names.
   It pulls users back to legacy catalog thinking. The template can still support ODPS product types such as `raw data`, `derived data`, and `dataset`, but the template name should focus on reuse and product thinking.

3. Separate product templates from access patterns.
   API, SQL, file, MCP, GraphQL, gRPC, and AI are access channels. They are not product templates by themselves.

4. Make Product Profile the universal minimum.
   Every ODPS data product should be able to start from a Product Profile.

5. Add richer templates by product intent.
   The template should answer what kind of product is being described, not how mature it is.

## Recommended template family

| Template | Purpose | Best for | Main ODPS schema areas | Typical ODPS product types |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ODPS Product Profile | Describe any data product at minimum level | Cataloging, portfolio inventory, discovery, basic ownership | `product.details`, `product.dataHolder`, `product.dataAccess` | Any product type |
| ODPS Reusable Data Product | Package reusable data for trusted consumption | Shared data assets, reference data, open data, internal reuse, source-aligned or derived data products | `product.details`, `product.dataHolder`, `product.dataAccess`, `product.dataQuality`, `product.SLA` | `raw data`, `derived data`, `dataset` |
| ODPS Analytical Product | Deliver insight, reporting, and decision support | Reports, analytical views, dashboards, indicators, decision-support products | `product.details`, `product.productStrategy`, `product.dataQuality`, `product.SLA`, `product.dataAccess` | `reports`, `analytic view`, `decision support` |
| ODPS Agentic Product | Serve AI agents, AI workflows, and automation | MCP, AI output ports, algorithms, automated decision-making, bi-directional workflows | `product.details`, `product.productStrategy`, `product.dataAccess`, `product.SLA`, `product.dataQuality`, `product.contract`, `product.license` | `algorithm`, `automated decision-making`, `data-driven service`, `bi-directional` |
| ODPS Marketplace Product | Package a data product for controlled or priced consumption | Marketplaces, pricing plans, licensing, contracts, payment gateways, partner sharing, internal chargeback | `product.details`, `product.productStrategy`, `product.pricingPlans`, `product.license`, `product.contract`, `product.paymentGateways`, `product.dataAccess`, `product.SLA`, `product.dataQuality` | Any product with controlled, priced, or contractual consumption |

## Access patterns

Access patterns should be modeled inside `product.dataAccess`. A single product can have several access channels.

| Access pattern | ODPS schema usage | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| File access | `product.dataAccess[].outputPortType: file` | Consumers download files such as CSV, Excel, JSON, XML, zip, or plain text |
| SQL access | `product.dataAccess[].outputPortType: SQL` | Consumers query the product through a database or query layer |
| API access | `product.dataAccess[].outputPortType: API` | Applications, platforms, or services consume the product through an API |
| GraphQL access | `product.dataAccess[].format: GraphQL` | Consumers need flexible query-based access |
| AI access | `product.dataAccess[].outputPortType: AI` | AI systems consume the product directly |
| MCP access | `product.dataAccess[].format: MCP` or `product.dataAccess[].specification: MCP` | AI agents consume tools, context, or actions through MCP |
| gRPC access | `product.dataAccess[].outputPortType: gRPC` | Low-latency system-to-system consumption is needed |
| sFTP access | `product.dataAccess[].outputPortType: sFTP` | Controlled batch transfer is needed |

## Template 1: ODPS Product Profile

### Intent

Use this as the minimum ODPS starting point for any data product.

It answers:

- What is this product?
- Who holds or owns it?
- How is it accessed?
- What is its status and visibility?

## Template 2: ODPS Reusable Data Product

### Intent

Use this when the product packages reusable data for trusted consumption.

It answers:

- How fresh or available must it be?
- How can consumers access it?
