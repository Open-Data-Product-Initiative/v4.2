# Open Data Product Specification (ODPS)

The **Open Data Product Specification (ODPS)** is a vendor-neutral, open-source, machine-readable metadata model for data products.  
It defines the key **objects, attributes, and relationships** that describe digital data products — enabling a consistent, interoperable way to manage, share, and monetize them.

Built on established standards such as **schema.org**, ODPS applies modern product thinking to data.  
It is designed for **both open and commercial data products**, supporting interoperability, monetization, and AI-native automation across ecosystems.

## New in ODPS 4.2 — Reusable Data Contract Profiles

Version 4.2 adds named Data Contract profiles under `product.contract`. Inline profile collections require `default`, may include additional contexts such as `internal` or `restricted`, and may be externalized as reusable packages. Data Access profiles can reference the contract profile that governs an interface.

The ODPS 4.1 singleton Contract form remains valid for backward compatibility. Profile-based contracts are recommended for new implementations.

```yaml
product:
  contract:
    default:
      id: CONTRACT-001
      type: ODCS
      contractVersion: 2.2.2
      contractURL: https://example.org/contracts/default
  dataAccess:
    API:
      outputPortType: API
      contract:
        $ref: '#/product/contract/default'
```

## Introduced in ODPS 4.1 — Connecting Data Products to Business Outcomes

Version 4.1 introduced the **`productStrategy`** object — an addition that connects data products directly to measurable business goals.

Data products can now declare:

- **Objectives** — the business intent or OKR objective the product supports.  
- **Product KPIs** — how success is measured at the product level.  
- **Business KPI (`contributesToKPI`)** — the higher-level outcome the product drives.  
- **Strategic Alignment** — optional references to corporate strategies or initiatives.

This makes ODPS 4.1 the **first open standard** to formalize the link between data products and business performance.  
It supports both **KPI** and **OKR** models, turning every YAML file into a living artifact of strategy execution — showing not just *what* a data product delivers, but *why* it matters.

**Example excerpt**

```yaml
productStrategy:
  status: Planned
  startDate: 2026-01-01
  endDate: 2026-12-31
  objectives:
    - en: "Enable smarter marketing campaigns"
  contributesToKPI:
    id: "KPI-OUT-001"
    name: "Retail Revenue Uplift"
    unit: "percent"
    target: 5
    direction: increase
    timeframe: "2025-Q4"
  productKPIs:
    - id: "KPI-OUT-001-A"
      name: "Customer dataset usage"
      unit: "downloads"
      target: 4000
```

## Specification Aims

* Enable **interoperability** between organizations, data platforms, marketplaces, and tools.  
* Reduce metadata conversion friction and errors between systems.  
* Accelerate the **design, testing, and deployment** of data products.  
* Power **tool automation** and **DataOps** through a shared schema.  
* Bridge the gap between **technical outputs and business outcomes**.  

> **Note:** In “Open Data Product,” the word *open* refers to the openness of the **standard**, not to open-data licensing or access.
